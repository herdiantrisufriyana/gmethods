# An implementation of g-methods

This package facilitates causal inference by implementing g-methods: g-formula,
inverse probability weighting (IPW), and g-estimation. These methods are
comprehensively described in Causal Inference: What If book by Hern√°n and Robins
using 1 of 4 NHEFS datasets described in this book
(https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/). This
package only provide nhefs table, a cleaned version of NHEFS data, for example
data. The remaining datasets from that book could be retrieved from cidata R
package (https://github.com/malcolmbarrett/cidata) for more information.
