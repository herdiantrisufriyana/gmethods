Description: This package facilitates causal inference by implementing
  g-methods: g-formula, inverse probability weighting (IPW), and g-estimation.
  These methods are  comprehensively described in Causal Inference: What If book
  by Hern√°n and Robins using 1 of 4 NHEFS datasets described in this book
  (https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/). This
  package only provides nhefs table, a cleaned version of NHEFS data, for
  example data. The remaining datasets from that book could be retrieved from
  cidata R package (https://github.com/malcolmbarrett/cidata) for more
  information.
